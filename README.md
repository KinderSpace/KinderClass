# Kinder Class

Educational platform done with [@agusgutierrezz](https://github.com/agusgutierrezz) as the final project of Ironhack's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. [Link to website](http://kinder-class.herokuapp.com/ "Kinder Class Website")

## Goal

Create an MVP single page application from scratch in 7 days using ReactJS, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB. Deployed with Heroku.

## Summary

Educational playground for kids and teachers. Where kids play games and teachers keep track of their improvements in real time.

## How it works?

Kids connect and wait (playing) in the main room. When everybody is logged in, the teacher sends in-game a designated game for the students. The kids then play the game. And afterwards the teacher can have a look at their performance in the Stats page and understand how the whole class is doing.
